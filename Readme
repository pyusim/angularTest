This is my solution to the Frontline coding challenge.

With this project, I am aiming to showcase my skills in setting up an AngularJS project, and creating a fully tested service that implements a non-trivial algorithm. The challenge was centered around an algorithm, so I deemed creating a UI that is anything but bare-bones to not be germaine to the project.

The project can be run from http://www.pavelyusim.com/angularTest/

It can also be built and run locally:

npm install
grunt build

Then run a server from the top level directory

The test cases are in the tests directory. Test cases can be run like this:

grunt unittests
